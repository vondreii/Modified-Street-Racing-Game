# Modified Street Racing Game #

## Overview ##
A modified version of the street racing game sourced from https://github.com/Microsoft/Imagine_street-racing

The game is a 3D street racing game where the player must avoid the cars and obstacles on the road.
The player scores points when avoiding these obstacles. There are two versions of the game:
* Avoiding cars
	* In the first version of the game (avoiding cars) roadblocks are transparent. Hitting them does not affect your score.
		However, hitting cars does affect your score.
* Avoiding both cars and roadblocks
	* In the second version of the game (avoiding cars and roadblocks), hitting both the roadblocks and the cars affect your score.
